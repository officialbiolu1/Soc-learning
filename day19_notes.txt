EMAIL ATTACK ANALYSIS(phishing,headers,payloads) 
 What makes an email suspicious: 
 -Urgency:Act now, Account suspended, Final warning. 
 -Threats or fear:Your account will be closed. 
 -Unknown sender or misspelled domain. 
 -Links that don't match what they say. 
 -Attachments:.zip, .exe, .html, .iso, .docm, .xlsm 
 -Bad grammar / weird formatting. 
 -Too good to be true offers. 
 HEADER ANALYSIS 
 we inspect From: (can be faked), Reply-To:(where replies really go), Return-Path: (true sender), Received: (path the email took), SPF/ DKIM/ DMARC result. 
 we focus on mismatch between From: and Return-Path, strange IPs/countries in Received: ,SPF/ DKIM = fail or soft fail 
 NOTE: If From domain is not the same as return-path domain, it is HIGH RISK.
 LINK INSPECTION 
 never click links.we only inspect them. We check if 
 -is it IP based?(e.g http://185.23.55.2) 
 -Does it use weird domain endings (.ru, .cn, .tk) 
 -Too many sub-domains?(paypal.secure.login.verify.ru) 
 NOTE: Legit companies don't use random subdomains or foreign domains. 
 ATTACHMENT ANALYSIS 
 High risk extensions: .exe, .msi, .vbs, .bat, .scr, .docm/ .xlsm(macros), .html(fake login page). 
 if this is seen as an analyst, FLAG IT, QUARANTINE IT, BLOCK SENDER, CREATE indicator(IOC) for the file name or hash.
 NOTE: Any attaachment + urgency = HIGH probability of malware. 
 TEST 
 -Why attackers prefer email: Attackers prefer email because it targets human trust and emotion while bypassing many technical controls.
 -Why headers is more important than body is because they reveal the true sender path, authentication results(SPF,DKIM,DMARC),and system behavior that cannot be hidden by visual tricks. 
 -Macros are dangerous because they allow hidden scripts to automatically execute malicious code, download payloads or open backdoors once enabled. 
 - Link inspection is important because the visible text can be legitimate while the actual URL redirects to a malicious domain or IP.
