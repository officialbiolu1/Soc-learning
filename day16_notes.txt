 Day 16 - Brute- Force + Credential Attack Detection 
 key logs to check: sudo journalctl | grep -i failed,authentication failure, invalid user , accepted.
  You also check sudo cat /var/log/auth.log | grep -i failed and grep -i accepted. 
 What a Brute-Force Attack looks like: Same IP repeating many times, Same username hammered repeatedly, Many users tried from one IP, A success(Accepted) after many failures
 Credential-Stuffing vs Brute-Force:
 Brute-force is many passwords tried on one account. 
 Credential stuffing is one password tried on many accounts. 
 Password spray is using common password(123456)on many users.
 Targeted attack is one account,repeated slow attempts.
 Simulated Test:
 If 1 IP hits 1 user 40 times in 2 minutes ,that is BRUTE-FORCE.
 If 1 IP tries 1 password on 50 users, that is CREDENTIAL STUFFING.
 If 1 IP tries 5 passwords slowly over 2 hours, that is TARGETED ATTACK.\N Defense Actions:
 After detecting brute-force attempts, the correct response includes monitoring, blocking the IP, reviewing account integrity, and strengthening authentication controls.
